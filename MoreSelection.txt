1. Process customer record

The program must then compute the sales tax and the total amount due,and print the customer’s name, purchase 
A program is required to read a customer’s name, a purchase amount and a tax code. 
The tax code has been validated and will be one of the following:
    0  tax exempt (0%)
    1  state sales tax only (3%)
    2  federal and state sales tax (5%)
    3  special sales tax (7%)


I:
input String name
input int puschaseAmount
input int taxcode
set double taxNum;
set double amountDue;

P:
Validate the taxcode variable to assign a number for taxNumber to compute amount Due
if (taxcode == 0)
taxNumber=0;
if (taxcode == 1)
taxNumber=0.03;
if (taxcode == 2)
taxNumber=0.05;
if (taxcode == 3)
taxNumber=0.07;

O:
calculate totalamountDue= purchaseAmount * taxNum;
Print (“Customer name: ”+ name);
Print (“Customer purchase: ”+ purchase);
Print (“Amount Due: ”+ totalamountDue);



2. Calculate employee's pay
A program is required by a company to read an employee’s number, pay rate and the number of hours worked in a week. The program is then to validate the pay rate field and the hours worked field and, if valid, compute the employee’s weekly pay and then print it and the input data.
Validation: According to the company’s rules, the maximum hours an employee can work per week is 60 hours, and the maximum hourly rate is $25.00 per hour. If the hours worked field or the hourly rate field is out of range, the input data and an appropriate message are to be printed and the employee’s weekly pay is not to be calculated.
Weekly pay calculation: Weekly pay is calculated as hours worked times pay rate. If more than 35 hours are worked, payment for the overtime hours worked is calculated at time-and-a-half.
 
I: 
input double payRate
input double workHours
double weeklyPay;
int overtime;
int payOvertime;
int MAX_HOURS=35;
double RATE_OVERTIME =1.5;

P:

If (workHours>60&&payRate>25)
If (workHours<=35&&payRate<=25)
weeklyPay=workHours * payRate
If ((workHours < 60&&workHours>35)&&payRate<=25)
overtime = workHours-MAX_HOURS
weeklyPay = MAX_HOURS * payRate
payOverTime = overtime *  RATE_OVERTIME
weeklyPay+= payRateOverTime

O:
Print(“The input is invalid”)
Print(“Employee number is: ”+ numberEmp)
Print(“Employee work hours: ”+workHours)
Print(“Your weekly pay is ” + weeklyPay)
Print (“Employee number is: ”+ numberEmp)
Print(“Employee work hours: ”+(workHours+overtime))
Print(“Your weekly pay is ” + weeklyPay)
